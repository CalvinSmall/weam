        Please paste relevant logs that were created when reproducing the error.
        
        Log locations:
        - Docker: Project root directory /usr/src/app/storage
        - Local: ./nodejs/storage
        
        There are two types of logs that can help diagnose the issue:
        - info (YYYY-MM-DD.log)
        - error (YYYY-MM-DD-error.log)
        
        Error logs contain exact stack traces and are especially helpful, but both can provide valuable information.
        Please only include the relevant portions of logs that correspond to when you reproduced the error.

        For UI-related issues, browser console logs can be very helpful. You can provide these as screenshots or paste the text here.
