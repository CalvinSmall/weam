# Crude Operation
Repository Pattern:
Purpose: The repository pattern abstracts away the details of data access, providing a clean interface for the application to interact with the database or other data storage mechanisms. It encapsulates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and allows the rest of the application to work with domain objects without needing to know about the underlying data storage implementation.
Responsibilities:
Handles database queries and commands.
Encapsulates data access logic.
Provides a clear separation between the application and the data storage layer.
Implementation:
Typically interacts directly with the database using an ORM or other data access libraries.
Provides methods for data retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion.
