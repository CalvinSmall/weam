Service Layer:
Purpose: The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It coordinates interactions between different parts of the system, applies business rules, and orchestrates data flow within the application. 
Services are responsible for executing high-level operations and enforcing business logic.
Responsibilities:
Implements business logic and rules.
Coordinates interactions between different components of the application.
Provides a high-level interface for performing complex operations.
Implementation:
Contains methods or functions that encapsulate specific business operations.
Utilizes repositories to access data but focuses on orchestrating operations rather than direct data manipulation.
Relationship:
Dependency: Services often depend on repositories to access data. The service layer typically uses repository methods to perform data retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion as part of its business operations.
Abstraction: The repository pattern abstracts away the details of data access, while the service layer abstracts away the details of business logic implementation. Together, they provide a separation of concerns that promotes modularity and maintainability in the application architecture.
