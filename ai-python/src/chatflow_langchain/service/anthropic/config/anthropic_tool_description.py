class ToolServiceDescription:
    WEB_ANALYSIS = '''
    Deeply analyze multiple or single webpages or URLs provided by the user.
    
    Functionality:
    - Fetch and parse page content: text, images, metadata.
    - Generate structured summaries.
    - Highlight important sections.
    - Extract entities, identify sentiment, themes, and key statistics.

    Parameters:
    - original_query (str): The current user's input query. **Do not modify** this parameter.
    - implicit_reference_urls (List[str]): A list of URLs that are implicitly referenced in the user's query.

    Runtime Behavior:
    - STRICTLY: Only the `implicit_reference_urls` parameter should be passed to the tool at runtime.
      This list must include all URLs implicitly referenced by the user's query.
    - Do not invoke this tool more than once per user query â€” all relevant URLs must be included in a **single call**.
    - Use `implicit_reference_urls` only when the user query **does not explicitly contain a URL**, 
      but instead refers to previously mentioned or related pages.
