# Integration of FastAPI, Celery, Flower and Docker & Docker-Compose for Improved Task Management and Deployment; Plus Extended Text Extraction Testing

## Key Achievements and Updates

### Workflow and Convention Improvements:
- **Established GitHub Branch Workflow and Naming Conventions**: After detailed discussions with the team, established workflow and naming conventions for GitHub branches, enhancing our development process's organization and efficiency.

### Development Enhancements:
- **Base Template Creation**: Developed a base template class for extracting text from URLs, standardizing text extraction methods across various content types.
- **Singleton Class for Boto3 Client**: Implemented a singleton design pattern for Boto3 client management, reducing code redundancy and improving manageability.
- **LocalStack S3 Bucket Setup**: Configured a LocalStack S3 bucket for efficient local development and testing, minimizing reliance on actual AWS services.

### Extractor Services and Testing:
- **Extractor Services Completion**: Finalized and tested PDF and DOCX extractor services, addressing issues with DOC file format to enhance compatibility and reliability.
- **Logging Functionality**: Incorporated detailed logging features, facilitating enhanced monitoring and debugging.
- **Text Extractor Mapping**: Introduced mappings for more accurate text extraction, ensuring proper association between the extracted text and its sources.

### Web Service and API Enhancements:
- **Define and Experiment with Docker File, FastAPI, and Celery Folder Structure**: Built a comprehensive folder structure for Docker, FastAPI, and Celery tasks, aiming for scalable and environment-independent deployment.
- **Organize Celery Tasks and FastAPI Web Service**: Reorganized the Celery tasks and FastAPI service to minimize future changes required for deployment across different environments or cloud platforms.
- **Endpoint for Celery Task Status**: Developed an endpoint within the FastAPI service to check the status of Celery tasks, enabling real-time monitoring and feedback.

### S3 Bucket Integrations and File Testing:
- **S3 Bucket Integrations**: Aided team members in setting up AWS S3 buckets and integrated Text Extraction S3 Service for direct extraction from hosted files.
- **Testing S3 URL File Extraction**: Conducted extensive testing of the text extraction service with various file formats (PDF, TXT, DOC, DOCX) hosted in S3 buckets, confirming successful operation.
- **Finalize API Testing**: Ensured seamless integration and functionality with AWS S3 services following comprehensive API testing with S3 PDF URLs.
- **Bug Resolutions**: Identified and fixed bugs post S3 service integration, stabilizing the service.
